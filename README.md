# Sewage cleaning robot
 A mobile robot, that can clean the sewage from underground pipelines using a cleaning mechanism
Intro 

Myself, Venkat Praneeth graduated from mechanical engineering field in 2018 at SUNY Farmingdale. Worked as a mechanical designer for one year during 2020 at a startup called Solinas Integrity where we create mobile robots for underground oil and gas pipeline inspections. 

Opting Skill ed 

Got interested in robotics when I was working at a startup and came to know that, I got to learn more skills related to robotics and prototyping. So, here I am to upskill my skills and chose the Skill ed program. 

At Skill ed 

Problem statement: To create a sewage cleaning mobile robot for underground pipelines. 

Strategy to prototype: Firstly, based on the time, budget and design considerations, I opted to build a small-scale version of sewage cleaning robot for 4-to-8-inch pipelines.  

Secondly, design of this mobile robot may change based on the locomotion and cleaning mechanism I'm going to use.  

Thirdly, choosing the type of mobile robot like 4 wheeled or snake type also varies based on the design. 

Lastly, considering all the above scenarios, I have to complete the whole prototyping of this project within 4 months.
